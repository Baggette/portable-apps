there are alot of games that do not have high system requirements that are on steam and do not have drm, this means you can copy the game's folder to your usb drive and use it anywhere. Alot of GOG games are good for this.

There are also alot of programs that you can just copy their installed folder over to yout usb drive and it will work.
